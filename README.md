## What is HookGenOS?

HookGenOS is a free, open-source web application that generates high-performing opening hooks for short-form and long-form content. Whether you create on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Twitter/X, or LinkedIn, the first 3 seconds of your content determine whether people stop scrolling — HookGenOS helps you nail it every time.

At its core, the app draws from a library of 60+ battle-tested psychological hook formulas — curiosity gaps, FOMO triggers, contrarian takes, pain-point openers, story lures, and more — that have been distilled from thousands of viral posts across platforms. Every hook is platform-aware: what converts on LinkedIn reads nothing like what stops a TikTok scroll. You enter your topic, choose your platform, and get a set of ready-to-use hooks in seconds.

HookGenOS is open source because great content tools should not be locked behind expensive SaaS subscriptions. Self-hosters can run the entire stack with a single Docker Compose command, connect their own OpenAI key for AI-powered generation, and optionally layer on Stripe to offer a paid tier to their own users. The MIT license means you can fork, modify, and even commercialize — no strings attached.

## Features

- **60+ psychological hook formulas** — curiosity gap, FOMO, contrarian, pain point, story, social proof, urgency, listicle, and more
- **Platform-optimized output** — hooks tuned for TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn
- **AI-powered generation via OpenAI** — optional; the app falls back gracefully to template-based generation if no API key is set
- **Free tier included** — 10 hooks per day, no credit card required
- **Pro tier via Stripe** — unlimited hooks, priority generation, and advanced filters ($9/mo)
- **Self-hostable** — single `docker compose up -d` command; bring your own secrets
- **Hook history & favorites** — every generated hook is saved; star the ones you love
- **One-click copy** — clipboard-ready output on every hook card
- **MIT licensed** — fork it, white-label it, make it yours

## Quick Start (Self-Hosted)

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | >= 20 |
| pnpm | >= 9 |
| PostgreSQL | >= 15 (or use Docker Compose) |
| Redis | Optional — used for rate-limit caching |

---

### Option 1: Docker Compose (recommended)

The fastest path to a running instance. Docker Compose starts PostgreSQL, the API, and the Next.js frontend for you.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YearningAsian/hookgenos
cd hookgenos
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set JWT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, and any optional keys
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To follow logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To run database migrations after the first boot:

```bash
docker compose exec api pnpm db:migrate
```

---

### Option 2: Manual Setup

Use this if you want to run against an existing PostgreSQL instance or develop locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YearningAsian/hookgenos
cd hookgenos
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at minimum:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

Then:

```bash
# Apply database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start all packages in parallel (API + App + Core watch)
pnpm dev
```

The API starts on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and the Next.js frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values below. Variables marked **Required** must be set for the app to start. Optional variables unlock specific features — the app degrades gracefully when they are absent.

### Core (Required)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/hookgenos` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing auth tokens — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` | `a1b2c3...` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secret for NextAuth session encryption — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` | `d4e5f6...` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Canonical URL of your frontend | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | URL the frontend uses to reach the API | `http://localhost:3001` |

### OpenAI (Optional — enables AI hooks)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key. If absent, the app uses template-based generation only. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`). Override to use `gpt-4o` or any fine-tuned model. |

### Stripe (Optional — enables Pro billing)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key (`sk_live_...` or `sk_test_...`). If absent, billing UI is hidden and all users get unlimited access. |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Stripe publishable key (`pk_live_...` or `pk_test_...`) — used in the frontend checkout flow. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`) — obtained from the Stripe dashboard after registering your endpoint. |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO_MONTHLY` | Price ID for the Pro monthly plan (`price_...`). Create this in your Stripe dashboard. |

### Redis (Optional — rate-limit caching)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string. If absent, rate limits fall back to in-memory storage (not suitable for multi-instance deployments). |

---

## Premium Subscription (Stripe)

HookGenOS ships with an optional Stripe integration that powers a Pro tier at $9/month. When Stripe is **not** configured, the billing UI is hidden and every user — including anonymous visitors — gets unlimited hook generation. This makes the app work perfectly out of the box for self-hosters who do not want to monetize.

### Setting up Stripe

1. **Create a Stripe account** at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com).

2. **Create a product and price:**
   - Go to **Products** in your Stripe dashboard.
   - Create a product named "HookGenOS Pro".
   - Add a recurring price of $9/month.
   - Copy the **Price ID** (`price_...`) — this becomes `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO_MONTHLY`.

3. **Get your API keys:**
   - Go to **Developers → API keys**.
   - Copy the **Secret key** and **Publishable key** into your `.env`.

4. **Register your webhook endpoint:**
   - Go to **Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**.
   - Set the endpoint URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/billing/webhook`
   - Select these events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

5. **Restart the API** — billing routes activate automatically when all four Stripe variables are present.

For local development, use [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to forward webhooks:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/api/billing/webhook
```

## Architecture

HookGenOS is a TypeScript monorepo managed with **pnpm workspaces** and built with **Turborepo** for caching and parallelization.

### How the packages fit together

**`packages/core`** is the heart of the system. It exports a `generateHooks(input)` function that accepts a topic, platform, and tone, then returns a ranked list of hooks. It has no runtime dependencies on the database or HTTP layer — it can be tested in isolation and imported into any Node.js process.

**`packages/api`** is a Fastify server that wraps `core` behind authenticated HTTP routes. It handles JWT issuance and verification, per-user rate limiting, Stripe billing webhooks, and persisting hook history to PostgreSQL via the Prisma client from `packages/database`.

**`packages/database`** owns the Prisma schema and exports a pre-configured `PrismaClient` instance. Migrations live here. Both the API and any scripts import from this package — there is one source of truth for the data model.

**`packages/app`** is a Next.js 14 app with the App Router. It communicates with the API via `API_URL` and uses NextAuth for session management. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and ships a dark theme by default.

### Request flow

```
Browser → Next.js App (packages/app)
              ↓ fetch /api/*
         Fastify API (packages/api)
              ↓ generateHooks()
         Core Engine (packages/core)
              ↓ OpenAI (optional) / templates
         Response → API → App → Browser
```
